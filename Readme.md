# Network and Computer Architectures

This folder contains three projects related to **Computer Architecture**, **Operating Systems**, and **Computer Networks**. Each project explores core concepts in these fields, with hands-on implementations using various programming languages.

## Computer Architecture

In this project, we implemented a **game** using **Assembly language**, exploring low-level programming and CPU architecture. The game showcases how computer hardware can be utilized for interactive applications.

## Operating Systems

This project involves creating a basic **operating system** using **C**. It handles and tracks messages, demonstrating core OS functionalities like process management and inter-process communication.

## Computer Networks

In this project, we built a **broker** system using **C++** for buying and selling **auctions**. It focuses on network protocols like **TCP** and **UDP**, message handling, and transaction management in a distributed system.
